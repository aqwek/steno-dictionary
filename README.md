# steno-dictionary
hosting my plover files for making a stenography dictionary at school

Current Goals:
 - Extension (Problems: RawStenoStroke that is used to translate to text isnt resetting after each stroke, just adds on the new strokes in steno order lol, not outputting text, not stopping the original keys being outputted)
 - Website 0%
 - Scratch Project: (Problems: storing the main.json is rly hard, im attempting using an ask block to store it currently. I've seen the image compresser, no idea how it works or how to use it)

main.json is in this if you want to use it, link for the code:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aqwek/steno-dictionary/main/plover/main.json

Might upload the extension to web store, I'll need to use it on my Chromebook
