hosting my plover files for making a stenography dictionary at school

I'm trying to make a reliable Plover emulator, with the entire dictionary, where you can use steno at school, no Plover needed. Hopefully in the future I can attempt to allow .json file uploads where you can upload your own plover folder and the website can use you dictionaries, but that is a long way away.
